#### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

- Overall my estimates were generally close to my predicted times, however I was in the habbit of
not timing myself so the actually times could vary 5 - 20 mins due to human error. Over the course 
I would say that this practice has improved and my estimates became much more realistic to my estimated 
times.

#### Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

- What I had learned from being reviewed by others is that I have a tendency to make mistakes that are
simple and are easily overlooked such as poor variable names, this forced me to 'refine the basics' so that 
moving forward my code follows that expected standards. What I have learned from reviewing others during this 
course is that majority of people are making the same sort of mistakes as me and that it is important that 
we fully read the task requirements prior to starting to ensure we are meeting all the requirements.

#### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

- Overall I felt that the practical tasks were sufficient in my learning and provided good examples
for assignment use and test revision. If I had to force a recommendation I would say the provided solutions
could be delayed abit, to really force me to push my learning as at times I felt I was looking at the solutions 
too early when I was coming to a solution myself, but then agian its up to the student if they look.
